# mason-browser-js
Javascript-based generic Mason API browser

Note: If you use a different url domain name for this index.html from that of your API web server, you must configure
your API server to allow cross-domain requests to make this app to work. Otherwise, you will end up getting something
like the following error on your browser's console:

    "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on
    the requested resource."
